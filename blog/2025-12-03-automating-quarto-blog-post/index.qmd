This website was previously compiled using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Hugo has a rather robust templating system, something I became fairly dependent on to create new blog posts, research pages, or class pages. It is a functionality that I sorely miss with the new version of this site that is built with [Quarto](https://www.quarto.org). I have lived with this for a while, as I sorted out the finer details of this site—not everything transferred one-for-one. Now that things are more or less settled, I'm looking for more quality of life upgrades so that I can use this site a bit easier. 

Enter [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com). I use Raycast for lots of things on my Mac; launching apps, searching the web (and specific parts of the web like Google Scholar), running little scripts (see [Key light shenanigans](../2024-11-08-lights)), etc. So, naturally, it seemed like a good way to automate creating the framework for a new blog post on this site. 

Some logistics. This blog lives in the `/blog/` folder and each post is also a folder named `/YYYY-MM-DD-title-as-slug/`. So, I need to replicate that. Raycast can take arguments and pass them to a bash script. Below is the general format for that (more information [here](https://github.com/raycast/script-commands/blob/master/documentation/ARGUMENTS.md)).

So, I open Raycast, type `Create Script Command`, enter a few bits of info, and save it. This creates the framework for a shell command. And you can see the output of that work, some taken from [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com), and some from me. The command asks you for the title of the blog post you want. It then grabs today's date, formats that text into a 5 word slug, and creates the folder necessary to get the process going. It then creates a `index.qmd` file with the necessary template information to begin a blog post.

Now, I enter the title of the post I want to make into Raycast, and I get out the shell of a post that I immediately begin editing. This should be relatively easy to remux into a templating system that allows me to recreate almost all of the Hugo functionality I enjoyed before. 

If you want to try it for yourself (and not necessarily just with  Raycast, this is a bash script, so it could be used in several ways), see the [Gist](https://gist.github.com/cbgoodman/81fc09b1708c0e438f5bcad8b5ea1d6a) below.
