Local government overlap is calculated similar to [Berry (2008)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2008.00344.x) by taking the ratio of all special districts, school districts, and overlapping townships to municipalities and non-overlapping townships in a county. Unlike Berry, this includes all forms of overlapping jurisdictions rather than just those with taxing power.
