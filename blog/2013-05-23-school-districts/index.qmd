[Bill Fischel](https://sites.dartmouth.edu/wfischel/) talking about his not so new book [Making the Grade: The Economic Evolution of American School Districts](https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo6823468.html). Of most interest, to me at least, is the process by which one room schools consolidated into the multi-school districts we have today.
