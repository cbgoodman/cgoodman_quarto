This site presents an archive of maps derived from the 2022 U.S. Census of Governments, which I have created to visualize the distribution of local government units across the United States. Currently, these maps are organized by county and by core-based statistical areas. Additional aggregations may be added in the future. 

## Map types

* All local governments
* All general-purpose local governments (municipalities and towns/townships)
* Municipalities
* Towns/townships
* School districts (combined independent and dependent)
* Special districts
* Special districts per municipality
* Hirschmann-Herfindahl Index ($1- \sum_{n=1}^5 share_{type}^2$)
