    "section": "",
    "text": "The most recent fiscal crisis and resulting economic environment has posed serious implications for the fiscal health of local governments. Local governments have been struggling with manipulating revenue structures in response to shrinking tax bases and decreased consumer demand for taxable goods and services. Some local property markets have seen significant decreases in home values; something that was never expected to happen. Assessed values have fallen and tax delinquency has risen, thereby leading to decreased property tax revenues. Demand for both consumer goods and fee-based government services has declined as unemployment is up and consumers have tightened their belts to deal with the economic crisis, which has led to significant shortfalls in sales tax and user fee revenues. All of these effects of the economic crisis and state of the economy directly influence the performance of local government revenue structures and consequently affect local government fiscal health.\n\n\n@incollection{carroll-goodman-2013,\n  author = {Carroll, Deborah A. and Goodman, Christopher B.},\n  address = {Sudbury, MA},\n  booktitle = {Handbook of Local Government Fiscal Health},\n  editor = {Justice, Jonathan B. and Levine, Helisse and Scorsone, Eric},\n  publisher = {Jones \\& Bartlett, Inc.},\n  title = {Understanding and Measuring Elasticity, Volatility, and Implications for Local Government Fiscal Health},\n  year = {2013}}"

    "section": "",
    "text": "The United States’ federal system is awash in local governments. As of 2017, the year of the last complete Census of Governments, there are 90,075 independent units of local government. Among the various forms of local government used, a plurality is a form of special-purpose local government called a special district. These districts are often single function (but sometimes not), sometimes conform to city or county boundaries (but sometimes not), and overlap all other forms of local government, including other special districts. The services provided by special districts are typically not unique; general-purpose local governments often provide the same services in other areas. The three most common special district functions include fire protection, housing and community development, and water supply – all functions provided by general-purpose local governments. The initial setup begs the question: Why do special districts exist? Moreover, perhaps more pressing, what are the implications for local fiscal outcomes?"

    "text": "American cities are creatures of their states, with states both granting and limiting the power of their cities. This relationship is characterized by how cooperative or competitive states are with cities in their legislation. Despite the recent attention given to state preemption of local laws, this is not a new phenomenon. Part of the confusion surrounding preemption is that there is no shared definition or understanding of its forms. The purpose of this article is to begin to create that shared conception. In doing so, we define preemption according to its historic origins as the use of coercive methods to substitute state priorities for local policymaking. We argue modern state preemption of local laws can be divided into four phases, each with their own policies and mechanisms. We show how preemption has changed over time, shifting the functional, legal, and political relationship between states and their cities. Together, these phases help assist policymakers and administrators in understanding the nature of state preemption, and thus how to create and implement local policies in an environment where the distribution of power between governments is competitive and changing."

Theoretical explorations of the potential influence of this institutional arrangement abound; however, empirical evidence as the influence of such an arrangement on local public sector remains relatively thin. Instead of competing for mobile resources as suggested by Tiebout, overlapping jurisdictions utilize similar tax and voting bases introducing a potential commons problem. Using a county-level dataset from 1972 to 2012, this commons problem is explored. The results suggest that a positive relationship between jurisdictional overlap and the size of local public workforce amounting to approximately a one percent increase in employment or an increase of less than one full-time equivalent employee."

Building on recent research, fragmentation and concentration variables are developed to incorporate the horizontal as well as the vertical dimensions. This analysis explicitly takes into account the potential simultaneity between individual preferences for the spatial arrangement of local governments and the size of the local public sector using the element of time. The findings suggest that increased levels of fragmentation lead to an enlargement of the local public sector; however, the results are more complex than expected. Similarly, the concentration of service delivery responsibilities into counties and single purpose districts tends to increase the size of the local public sector."

Previous studies have indicated that it is costly to provide public services in areas with low‐density, spatially expansive development, leading to higher per capita expenditures. However, theory would suggest alternate outcomes. This paper examines this question using a panel dataset of U.S. urban county areas and a specification allowing for potential nonlinearity between development patterns and per capita expenditures. Estimates indicate that the spatial extent of development is the most important factor in expenditures; it is less costly to provide public services when development is more compact. Higher density increases per capita expenditures; however, the effects are small."

    "text": "Although the Great Recession put the U.S. economy into a tailspin, we know little about how the changes in house prices influenced property tax collections. Using local level housing data from Zillow® matched to property tax data from 1998 to 2012, two questions are examined. First, the elasticity of property tax revenue with respect to house values is estimated. Second, the timing of this elasticity is determined. The analysis rules out that local policymakers capture the entire increase of house value in property tax revenues but unable to rule out that increases in house values are completely offset by changes in effective property tax rates. Decreases in values have an elasticity between 0.3 and 0.4 and take three years for changes in values to impact property tax revenues. While property tax collections declined, local policymakers adjusted effective millage rates such that revenues did not decline as much as home values."

Findings suggest that characteristics of the property tax base are the most important predictors of property tax revenue volatility among counties over time. Specifically, increases in assessed value and years in which a mass revaluation occurs are most influential in determining property tax revenue volatility. The second stage of analysis reveals that population, nontax revenue dependence, property tax dependence, and assessment quality have the greatest influences on volatility of other revenues among counties over time. The effect of assessment quality on nonproperty tax revenue volatility is conditional upon a county’s property tax dependence."

    "text": "Many affordable housing policies are the domain of local governments. While subnational housing policies can be used to increase racial and economic segregation, they can also protect renters, and thus are not without controversy. Local affordable housing policies include inclusive zoning, rent control, short-term rental regulation, and source of income anti-discrimination. Starting in the 1980s, states began to preempt these local laws, preventing their cities from adopting affordable housing policies. We ask why states choose to preempt one or more of these four affordable housing policies. Using a cross-sectional, time-series dataset of preemptions, we find evidence that more conservative legislatures are more likely to adopt preemptions, while more professional legislatures and states with higher rental rates and previous preemptions are less likely to preempt. Contrary to expectations, interest group density, electoral competition, and policy diffusion are not significant predictors of preemption. For advocates and policymakers concerned with increasing affordable housing in their jurisdictions, these results raise unease about the ability to further an affordable housing agenda at the local level, particularly in more conservative political environments, suggesting instead affordable housing may need to return to the purview of the federal government."

    "text": "We examine the influence of property tax delinquency on the sale price of nearby homes from 2002 to 2013 using more than 46,000 residential property sales in a representative midwestern central city—Milwaukee, Wisconsin. After controlling for a number of property and neighborhood characteristics including nearby foreclosures, we find property tax delinquency has a significant influence on nearby home sales. The relationship is negative; one additional tax delinquent property within 250 m of a home sale is associated with a discounted sale price of 0.79% or approximately $1,085 on average. In addition, the influence of tax delinquent properties on home sale prices diminishes with distance, suggesting blight is the source of the discount. Based on these findings, the negative influence of tax delinquency is likely to be exacerbated in central cities where housing density is greater and delinquency is higher and more persistent than the surrounding suburbs, which has the potential to lead to fiscal distress as property taxes are the primary revenue source for cities. As such, we suggest a two-tiered approach for cities to mitigate the negative consequences of tax delinquency: a combination of policies to eliminate delinquency and also to help homeowners become financially stable."

We examine the factors associated with the honesty of organizations in the nonprofit sector using Benford’s Law, which tests for abnormalities in data that result from intentional falsification. Using the 990 tax filings for 51,010 nonprofits in the United States from 2012 and 2013, we find evidence of problems in the accuracy of their financial reporting.

We combine these records with parcel-level data on residential home sales to identify each institution’s exact location and type. Using a traditional hedonic model and a repeat sales model, we examine the influence of nearby tax-exempt properties on residential home sales. We find from the repeat sales model that close proximity (0m-250m) to educational properties, labor halls, and utilities are associated with lower home sale prices, all else equal.

However, little research has been conducted to see if operating and capital expenses are driven by the public’s perception of need or are a policy consequence of functional specialisation. The following study tests how problem salience and form of government interact to impact local governments’ expenditures. We use National Transit Data (2013–2014) to test these moderating relationships. Our findings indicate that at least in the context of public transit, service area characteristics play a larger role in the spending and expansion than either the form of government or issue salience (as measured in this paper). This also indicates that the moderating effect of salience and governance does not appear to be significant for public transit policy."

    "text": "This study exploits exogenous policy discontinuities along state borders to estimate the influence of differences in local autonomy on the usage of special districts in U.S. counties. Using forty years of data, this analysis compares counties on either side of state borders where local autonomy differs and finds little to no evidence that negative changes in local autonomy leads to increased utilization of special districts. This study suggests that some prior literature may overstate the importance of local autonomy in local service delivery."

    "section": "",
    "text": "The U.S. emergency and disaster response system is designed to operate bottom-up, meaning responses are intended to begin at the local level with state and federal governments stepping in to assist as needed. The response to the current COVID-19 outbreak, however, has been something else entirely, as each level of government competes with the others over resources and authority. Some states preferred a local response with state support, while other states took a more uniform, state-mandated response enabled by state preemption of local actions. The latter has revealed an often-dormant means of state preemption of local ordinances: the executive order preemption. Local government managers will have to be creative in balancing responsiveness to their constituents in this time of crisis while also being constrained by their states. The administrative choices are likely to have both immediate and long-term consequences for future emergencies."

    "text": "There are several explanations as to why the total number of local governments may fluctuate, including financial viability and purpose. Many speculate the current economic recession will lead to fewer governments. Yet public choice theorists would assert that more fragmentation, not less leads to more efficient government, which should lead to more, not less local governments (Tiebout 1956). Therefore the following paper further explores the micro and macro reasons behind the reduction or increase in the number of local governments in the United States. Using county-level data from five Census of Governments from 1982 to 2002, we test whether the number of local governments in the US increases or decreases during an economic shock.\n\n\n@article{goodman-leland-2013,\n  author = {Goodman, Christopher B. and Leland, Suzanne M.},\n  journal = {Public Finance \\& Management},\n  number = {2},\n  pages = {58-79},\n  title = {Cost shocks and their relationship to the creation, consolidation and dissolution of US local governments},\n  volume = {13},\n  year = {2013}}"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Special districts are a numerous and unique form of local government in the United States. Unlike cities, counties, and towns, special districts are created and dissolved often. Using tools from the industrial organizations literature, this analysis examines patterns in creation and dissolution of special districts using Census of Governments data from 1972 to 2017. Overall, the rate of entry (creation) has been declining over time while the rate of exit (dissolution) has remained steady. New districts tend to be small relative to existing districts and and exhibit slow growth over time. Lastly, special districts do not appear susceptible to the “liability of newness” or exhibit high levels of infant organizational mortality that is common in the private sector."

    "section": "",
    "text": "What happens to service provision when a special district enters the public service market? Theoretically, special districts can act either as complements by supplementing existing service provision, or as substitutes by supplanting current service provision. We find a substitution effect using fixed effects regression on urban counties in the United States from 1972 to 2017. Special districts replace public service provision by county governments; however, we find no similar result for municipal governments. The results are nuanced – findings are confined mainly to spatially expansive public services like fire protection, sewerage, and solid waste management. Furthermore, we find evidence that day-to-day operations drive observed substitution and that county size is an important factor depending on the functional service area."

    "section": "",
    "text": "After analyzing 35 years of data, this study finds that the dissolution of special districts, “exits” in U.S. counties, are largely unrelated to demand factors. Using fixed effects regression specified at the all county and urban county levels, we find that restrictions of fiscal autonomy of cities are associated with decreases in the special district exit rate. There is also evidence that state grants of “broad” or “limited” functional home rule to cities increases special district dissolutions. The findings are consistent with the circumvention argument, made in the local autonomy literature, and may also indicate some service consolidation albeit from a different perspective."

    "text": "This article discusses the influence of state legislative ideology on the legislative preemption of local ordinances in the area of worker rights. States define the powers of local governments within their purview and states may use this power to restrict local governments from pursuing certain policies. Using data on state legislative activity and ideology from 1993 to 2016, I find within-state increases in legislative ideology, indicating increased legislative conservatism, associated with an increased risk of preempting local government policy, all else equal. This finding is robust to a number of alternate specifications and hypotheses. Ideology appears to play an important role in the decision to involve the state in the affairs of local governments."

    "title": "Florida is dissolving the Reedy Creek Improvement District, home of Disney World. What happens next is anyone’s guess.",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Following criticism from the Disney company over a controversial education bill, last week Florida’s Governor, Ron DeSantis signed legislation which would dissolve the Reedy Creek Improvement District, the location of the company’s Disney World Resort. Chris Goodman explains the history of the special district, how it has functioned, and the uncertainty around what may happen next.\nOn April 22, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed legislation, dissolving the Reedy Creek Improvement District, effective June 1, 2023, apparently in reaction to the Disney corporation’s opposition to the state’s recently enacted Parental Rights in Education bill, which limits classroom instruction on gender identity and sexual orientation. The politics of this action notwithstanding, what exactly is going on and who is involved? What is the Reedy Creek Improvement District, and why does it matter that it’s being dissolved? Welcome to the shadowy world of special districts.\nLet’s back up. In the United States, there are five main forms of local government. The first three are cities, counties, and in 27 states, town or townships are general purpose local governments. They provide many services, tax residents and levy fees, and issue debt to support infrastructure. They’re often the local governments that people identify with. The fourth are school districts. Finally, we have special districts. Typically, these local governments provide a single service to a fixed geographic area. They often have the power to tax (mostly property tax but sometimes other taxes too) or levy fees for services (like transit fares or water fees). Some special districts have the power to issue debt. The Reedy Creek Improvement District (RCID) in central Florida, and home to the Walt Disney World Resort, falls in this camp; however, in 1967 the state endowed the RCID with many more powers, powers generally associated with a city or county. These services are to the benefit of landholders, primarily the Disney Corporation and its subsidiaries, and are largely paid for by taxes and utility fees.\n\n\n\nCredit: Asher Heimermann, CC BY-SA 4.0, via Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nThe RCID is responsible for services such as environmental planning, water control, roadway maintenance, emergency services, and water, sewer, and electrical utilities. If you think that these sound like many of the services a city provides, you would be correct. These services are supported by property taxes and utilities fees levied on the landowners inside the RCID. In effect, Disney taxes or charges itself to provide services it values.\nThe RCID is like another kind of special district in Florida, the Community Development District (CDD). CDDs exist primarily to facilitate the issuing of bonds to fund infrastructure development in new residential developments. They allow housing developers to put in roads, water pipes, sewer lines, and other things, pay for them with debt, and pay the debt off by charging an additional property tax to new homeowners. Rather than increase the purchase price of new housing, CDDs allow the cost of necessary infrastructure to be spread over time. CDDs differ from the RCID in a few important ways. CDDs are more limited in their ability to provide public services, and importantly, CDDs have a completely different governance structure. CDD’s governing board members are initially allocated by the amount of land an owner has in the district. As the primarily landowner, this is the developer. As homes are sold, board seats convert to popular election until the entire governing board comprises popularly elected members. The RCID is different in that landowners always control the board seats. As such, the Disney Corporation and its subsidiaries control the decisions made about service delivery and infrastructure within the district.\n\nWhat next for the Reedy Creek Improvement District?\nThe RCID is dissolving in 2023. What now? The answer to this question is unclear. The legislation inserts a single paragraph into the Florida statutes and does little to explain how the dissolution will occur or what happens during the process. Undoubtedly, the law will be subject to litigation; however, the RCID, like all special districts in Florida, is subject to the The Uniform Special Districts Accountability Act, which outlines how independent special districts dissolve. This law specifies the debt and assets of a dissolving special district be transferred to a local general-purpose government, who assumes responsibility for paying off the debts and/or continuing to provide services. This likely means Orange (and possibly Osceola) County will have some responsibility for the transferred debt and assets.\nImportantly, the tax levy that supports the RCID is also eliminated upon dissolution. Currently, the RCID taxes itself about double the average property rate of Orange County, FL. If Orange County assumes the debt, assets, and service delivery requirements of the RCID, it must do so with its own (lower) property tax levy. This could mean taxpayers county-wide will foot the bill in the form of future tax increases, or it might not.\nLittle about the process is known. Many of the actors in the process of dissolution have yet to be assigned their roles. The uncertainty of the process is the issue. If an implementation plan accompanied the dissolution, the responsible parties could react and plan for what happens on June 1, 2023. Right now, we’re left with many questions and few answers."

    "text": "Property tax in the US.\n\n\n\nWhile the levels of usage give us one perspective, we might be more interested in changes over time. Data at this level of aggregation is only available every 5 years. Below we see the change from 2002 to 2007. Black colored counties show an increase in property tax reliance and white show a decrease. Unsurprisingly, a number of counties increased their usage. Housing was booming during this period and it is likely local policymakers couldn’t resist taking advantage of this to increase revenues. However, we cannot rule out that rates also increased.\n\n\n\n\nProperty tax change in the US.\n\n\n\nA one time period change doesn’t necessarily tell us how the usage of the tax has changed over the long term. To examine this, the change from 1972 to 2007 is shown in the map below. The same scale is used as the previous map. We see a much different trend here with a vast majority of counties decreasing their reliance on the property tax. Increases in reliance on the property tax are largely limited to Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n\n\n\n\nLong run change in property tax change in the US.\n\n\n\nDespite its virtues, reliance on the property tax has declined. And where reliance has increased is spatially clustered in just a few states. What does all of this mean? Many local governments are turning away from an extremely stable and easy to administer revenue source to more volatile revenues (primarily local option sales taxes, where applicable, and user charges). Unfortunately, we will have to experience a few more recessions to fully understand if this potential volatility translates into significant issues for local governments."

It's not usually something that is specifically taught in graduate school even though it's incredibly important to an academic's professional life. There are many ways to go about this (low tech to super high tech), but the purpose of this post is to explain one tool that I have found incredibly useful and flexible. That tool is Notion (notion.so). Notion can do way more than I am going to explain (see Using Notion as Your Second Brain), but this is how I use it to keep track of writing projects throughout the process of development to publication.\n            Continue reading\n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                        dataviz\n                    \n                    \n                        maps\n                    \n                    \n                        local govt\n                    \n                \n            Per Capita General-Purpose Local Governments, 2017\n                      \n                May 16, 2020\n            \n            \n            Continue reading\n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                        dataviz\n                    \n                    \n                        maps\n                    \n                    \n                        local govt\n                    \n                \n            Per Capita Local Governments, 2017\n                      \n                May 7, 2020\n            \n            \n            Continue reading\n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                        property tax\n                    \n                    \n                        public finance\n                    \n                \n            Speculating on the Impact of COVID-19 on Chicagoland Property Taxes\n                      \n                April 17, 2020\n            \n            \n            Continue reading\n        \n    \n    \n        \n                \n                    \n                        dataviz\n                    \n                    \n                        r\n                    \n                \n            How to Desaturate Figures for Publication using R\n                      \n                February 25, 2020\n            \n            \"Many academic journals require figures in greyscale.

A lot has changed (or I perceive it to have changed) since the last time I did this so I endeavored to find a way to record/edit all my lectures on an iPad Pro. To be clear, I made this harder on myself by restricting everything to be done on an iPad. But I want something reasonably portable in case I need to record on the go.\n\n            Continue reading\n        \n    \n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "This disconnect between estimation and visualization adds an extra step (and could be solved by doing the estimation in R, something I have decided not to do for the time being) and prevents me from using one of the many R packages for coefficient plotting. Therefore, I estimate 4 regressions in Stata (using my preferred reghdfe command) and extract the coefficients, standard errors, and standard deviation (for standardization) of each variable along with the model label. I then move over to R. Borrowing heavily from Thomas Leeper and Andrew Heiss, I import the data, standardize the coefficients and standard errors, and build the plot (see below).\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\n\nplot.data <- read_excel(\"popgrow-coeff.xlsx\", sheet = \"popgrow\", col_types = c(\"guess\", \"numeric\", \"numeric\", \"numeric\", \"guess\"))\n\nmultiplier <- qnorm(1 - 0.05 / 2)\n\nplot.data <- plot.data %>%\n  mutate(std.est = estimate * sd,\n  std.se = se * sd,\n  ymin = std.est - (multiplier * std.se),\n  ymax = std.est + (multiplier * std.se),\n  term = factor(term, levels = rev(c(\"Central city population share\",\n  \"Suburban municipal fragmentation\",\n  \"Suburban unincorporated population\",\n  \"School district decentralization\",\n  \"Special district overlap\",\n  \"ln population\",\n  \"Real per capita money income\",\n  \"Growth in log population, 1950-1960\",\n  \"Unemployment rate\",\n  \"Manufacturing share\",\n  \"% population with 16+ year education\")), ordered = TRUE),\n  group = factor(group, levels = c(\"1960 to 1970\",\n    \"1960 to 1980\",\n    \"1960 to 1990\",\n    \"1960 to 2000\"), ordered = TRUE))\n\np <- ggplot(plot.data, aes(x = term, y = std.est)) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = \"#000000\", size = 0.75) +  # Line at 0\n  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax, group = rev(group), color = group), position = position_dodge(width = 0.75), size = 1, fatten = 1.25,\n    show.legend = T) +  # Ranges for each coefficient\n  labs(x=\"Coefficient\", y=\"Standardized Estimate\", title=\"Population Growth\") +  # Labels\n  coord_flip() +  # Rotate the plot\n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(legend.position=\"bottom\",\n    legend.title = element_blank())\n\nThe primary issue is the 4 models are highly related so using something like facet_wrap is a bit inappropriate. I want the coefficients stacked. This is easily achieved using the group option in geom_pointrange. A little adjustment is necessary to get the points and ranges to be more visible in what will eventually be a printed figure. The output can be seen below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI think this is a very clean way to display a lot of dense information. An added benefit is facet_wrap can be used for subgroup analysis."

    "text": "How a type of local government you may have never heard of may be costing you a bit more\nLSE US Centre Blog\nSpecial districts are one of the most common forms of local government in the US. Aimed at tackling a specific issue in a certain area, these districts can often overlap with city and county governments. In new research Christopher Goodman looks at whether this overlap can mean an over-provision of public employees. He finds that while this overlap can often lead to a small increase in the number of public employees, the effect is much greater on local revenues – i.e. taxes – which can be up to ten percent greater.\nSpecial districts are a unique and very popular form of local government in the United States. They can overlap any other forms of local government such as cities or counties, take on nearly any geographic shape, and provide public services similar to cities. This arrangement creates the potential for the over-provision of public services due to a lack of coordination between numerous overlapping governments. This has been found to be the case with local government revenues as well as public debt, but the question remains if this over-provision extends to local government’s most common cost, employees. In general, the answer is yes, but the size of the “overlap effect” is quite small.\nSpecial districts are the single most numerous form of local government in the US as of 2012. Their unique attributes make them attractive for solving all manner of local issues. Need to run a metro-wide transit agency? A special district fits the bill. Need to provide a particular public service to a particular neighborhood? A special district works here too. This flexibility allows areas to tailor the collection of public services they receive to fit their needs. There are of course those who think this kind of fragmentation of public service provision is bad and can lead to all kinds of ill effects.\nBack the original claim. Why would the lack of coordination among many special districts lead to an over-provision of public services? Ideally, it wouldn’t; however, we do not live in an ideal world. The single service nature of many special districts is the source of the problem. Most special districts have one job to do: provide the service they were created to provide. This naturally leads elected officials and public managers to want to do that job more and better. Potentially so much more than it becomes more than what would ordinarily be provided. If the various services provided by a collection of special districts were instead provided by a single city government, all those services (likely organized into departments) would have to compete with each other in the annual budget process for funds. This competition would keep things in line. Because each service is provided by (and funded by revenues from) a separate and autonomous special district, there is no budget competition and the potential for over-provision is born.\nNote what I just described requires no one, elected or appointed officials, public managers, or voters, to do anything wrong. All that is required is for those groups to do what they normally do. Elected officials favor policies that will get them reelected. And it’s likely those same elected officials are at least somewhat interested in the public service the district provides. Both are completely rational, but also likely result in more public goods or services being provided than would be in a city government.\nMost local government services are highly labor intensive; therefore, if there is an over-provision problem, it should show up in more local public employees than would ordinarily be employed. This is accomplished by comparing the level of local public employment across all types of local governments in areas with high number of special districts per city such as St. Louis City, Missouri to areas with low special districts per city like Baltimore City, Maryland.\nOf course, these areas may employ more or less public workers for reasons other than special district overlap such as the prevailing wage (local governments tend to hire fewer workers when wages are high), revenues from state or federal government (local governments often hire more workers when someone else is partially paying for them), or the wealth of the community.\nIn particular, I examine this relationship in all county areas in the United States from 1972 to 2012. On average, a county has about 40 full time equivalent local public employees per 1,000 residents and roughly 2 special districts per city. Overall, the results of the statistical modeling suggest there is an upward bias in the number of local public employees in areas with more special district overlap, the size of the effect is quite small. Moving from the 25th percentile of overlap (0.5 special districts per city) to the 75th percentile (2.3 special districts per city) increases in level of local public employment by about one percent or less than one full time equivalent employee. When compared to the overlap effect of local revenues (approximately a 10 percent increase), these findings appear quite small indeed.\n\n\n\n\n\nSo what?\nIt’s generally thought that competition between many local governments is a means to constrain inefficient behaviors of those governments. However, this theory was built on competition between horizontally arranged local governments (e.g. cities); governments that do not overlap one another. While informative, most of the growth in US local governments over the last 50 years has been in the vertical direction by numerous overlapping special districts. This is a fundamentally different arrangement where it appears the competitive forces that constrain cities do not apply.\nWhile the “overlap effect” does not appear to be particularly large for local public employment, it is for other local outcomes (revenues, specifically). This disconnect begs the question if these two results are truly the state of US local governance, where are the excess tax dollars being spent? The results of my research suggest not on employees (at least not directly) so there’s more of the puzzle to be completed.\nThis article is based on the paper, “Jurisdictional Overlap and the Size of the Local Public Workforce” in State and Local Government Review."

I’m not entirely sure students stop to take the time to think about what concepts an exam question is meant to probe beyond the immediate task in the question.\nFrom here I diverge somewhat with what others have done. I offered this as a small amount of extra credit to anyone who turned in a proposed question. From this pool, I chose 3 questions (and added a 4th of my own to round out the topics) to appear on the exam.

It gets the students to think about what they are learning in multiple ways that can be difficult to do otherwise. Specifying a learning objective allows them to be contemplative about the big topics in the course and then narrow them down to something more manageable. It also allows for application of these topics to a particular context; a context that the student is likely familiar with. In the NIU MPA program, we are particularly concerned with translating in-class experiences to the workplace.1 This small task allows some more abstract concepts to be applied.\nOverall, I am fairly happy with how this experiment has gone so far.\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nFor context, our program requires all students to either be working in the public/non-profit sector or engaged in an internship.

    "text": "Why your sprawling, low-density suburb may be costing your local government money\nLSE US Centre Blog\nEven with the recent resurgence of urban living, the United States is a country of suburbs. There is plenty of debate about the full extent of this suburbanization, but some of it is clearly sprawl. Sprawl has an even more complicated definition, lending itself to a “I know it when I see it” interpretation. My working definition is excessive suburbanization; development that likely wouldn’t have taken place if developers and/or residents had to internalize the costs they impose on society. The question at hand is whether this kind of development induces higher spending on the part of local governments than it otherwise would have spent. In general, the answer is yes; however, it is complicated.\nWhat are some of the reasons that normal suburbanization might turn to urban sprawl? In general, there are three reasons. First, developers may fail to consider the social value of open space. This leads an overzealous conversion of land from open space (like agricultural land) to residential or commercial uses. Second, individuals may fail to consider the social cost of their commuting patterns leading to housing being built far from employment centers. Finally, developers may fail to consider all the public costs of their developments. This last reason is the connection to local government spending. It has been suggested that it is costlier to provide public services in areas of sprawl because this type of development pattern fails to capitalize on economies of scale, often fails to optimize the location of costly capital facilities, and leads to duplicative service delivery. More compact development patterns can help to contain these costs.\nDensification, one potential remedy for sprawl, comes with its own potential impacts on local government spending. There could be economies of density whereby public costs are lowered because development and people are clustered closer together. There is another possibility, however. Because of physical proximity, providing public services could become more expensive; a concept referred to as “urban harshness.” The general logic is that dense urban areas require more “stuff,” traffic lights, police officers, teachers, than less dense areas to provide a similar level of public services. It is somewhat unclear which of these two views of sprawling (or not) development will impact public spending.\n\n\n\n\n\nI examine this relationship between urban development and public spending in metropolitan counties areas in the United States from 1982 to 2012. I examine sprawl in two dimensions: horizontally and vertically. To measure the horizontal aspect, I use the USDA National Resource Inventory data to calculate the percentage of a county that is considered urban. In general, if small or very large percentages are found, that is an indication of more compact development. In the vertical dimension, I use population plus jobs density (population plus jobs divided by urban land). The idea for this is that urban or suburban areas exist for multiple uses. Some purely residential, some purely commercial, and others a mixed of the two. Only measuring one aspect gives a false sense of density, especially as it relates to public finance. Those office towers that are largely empty at night still require public services.\nIn general, I find that more compact development (think mixed-use medium rises) is less costly to provide public services; however, more dense development (think skyscraper offices and apartments) is more costly to provide public services. The relative size of the effects are not equivalent. More compact development has significantly more potential to reduce public spending than any associated increase in density could offset. In the average county area, if density increased from the 25th percentile to the 50th percentile, per capita expenditures would increase by $5.26. If the percentage of developed land was reduced from the 50th percentile to the 25th percentile in the average county, per capita expenditures would decline by $60.86. This finding suggests that if development patterns were to shift to more dense and compact development, there will be a reduction in public spending on average.\nMoreover, some spending categories are more affecting by development patterns than others. Eduction, police, fire, libraries, sewerage, and solid waste management would all see likely reductions in per capita expenditures if development was more compact. This shouldn’t be too surprising as all of these services require traversing space or efficiently locating a building. In the case of education or libraries, it can be difficult to efficiently locate facilities when students or residents are spread out. For the others, spacing development far apart means needing more “stuff” to effectively provide public services; more police cars, fire trucks, miles of sewer lines, or garbage trucks.\nSo what?\nMy results suggest that more compact and dense development can pay dividends in lowering public expenditures. The key policy question is how to achieve that. Effectively designed impact fees that internalize the social costs of sprawl on developers (and likely passed along to new homeowners) are one mechanism. However, our ability to do this effectively appears somewhat lacking. Statewide growth management or local urban containment policies may be a mechanism to reduce growth on the urban fringe and thereby reduce expenditures. Promoting infill development is another mechanism to stem growth on the urban fringe. All of this is to say that there are policy options to reduce sprawl and to the extent those policies are successful a secondary effect is a likely reduction in local public spending.\nThis article is based on the paper, “The Fiscal Impacts of Urban Sprawl: Evidence From U.S. County Areas” in Public Budgeting and Finance."

    "text": "Let’s back up\nFor those of you who may not have read the original post.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotion is free for educators. Just put in your .edu email address, and you’re good to go. Notion is mainly a holding area for all kinds of content, but one of its most potent tools is relational databases. We can link all sorts of data together to surface more helpful information about what we should be working on.\n\n\nMain project database, reimagined\nThe original design of this was for a main project database. It included all kinds of information about projects, but it was mainly a spreadsheet at the end of the day. You could do similar things in nearly any spreadsheet program. The main project database still exists (named ‘Manuscript Status’) but is now linked to do additional databases for more functionality. Let’s jump right in.\n\nThe building blocks\nAs mentioned above, the primary component of this system is the Manuscript Status database. Each entry in this database represents a single manuscript and includes a lot of metadata on each project. We’ll use that metadata on the main page to surface helpful information, but it’s also beneficial in keeping track of all kinds of relevant information specific to each project.\n\n\n\n\nManuscript 1 Metadata\n\n\n\nAs seen above, there are a few pieces of vital information (and many hidden details, click “6 more properties” to see it all). Is the project active? What is its status? This bit is linked to another database; I’ll explain more in a moment. What Journal is it current at or targeted for? Or what conference is it being submitted to?\n\n\n\n\nManuscript 1 Content\n\n\n\nFurther down, this page includes all the relevant data about this manuscript. It consists of the abstract, some more metadata like information and checklists, notes about the project, and any reviewer/editor comments that might have come back. These comments are in their own database and linked, relationally, to this particular manuscript. Any comments related to this manuscript in the Manuscript Reviews database will show up in this section.\n\n\n\n\nManuscript 1 Reviews\n\n\n\nThis portion can be highly customized. And it’s not too dissimilar to the original database. What is vastly different is how data is surfaced on the main page.\n\n\nTo-dos\n\n\n\n\nThe All Active Projects view\n\n\n\nA neat feature of Notion is you can display databases (a type of page) any number of times in multiple places. Each of these individual instances of a database can have its own views or methods of sorting, filtering, or otherwise displaying the data. These can be pretty powerful when used effectively!\nThe ‘To-Do’ panel at the top of the page is one such instance of a database (the Manuscript Status database). It shows active projects in one view (active = marked active and either in-process or R&R’ed), conference papers in another view, and overdue projects in a third view (those past their due dates). These views surface relevant items to work on—active projects requiring work, with near-term due dates.\n\n\n\n\nThe Conference Papers view\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore contextual information\nBelow the to-do section is a lot of contextual information.\n\n\n\n\nThe All Active Projects view\n\n\n\nOn the left-hand side is the Status database, showing all manuscripts in the central database. If you click on one of the boxes, it will display all the relevant manuscripts in that category. It’s an easy way to surface all of the manuscripts at one time that meets specific status criteria.\n\n\n\n\nAll in-process manuscripts in the Manuscript Status database\n\n\n\nThe right-hand side lists all manuscripts in the Manuscript Status database and a view to show only published work (easy to find all in one place for annual reviews, tenure, etc.). Underneath that is where all the databases that make this entire system work live. The page is self-contained, though Notion will allow linking across heavily nested databases.\n\nTemplates\nThroughout, there are templates for adding content. Need to add a new manuscript to the main database? Click on “new” in either instance of the Manuscript Status database on the front page and click “New Manuscript Template.” The manuscript page is pre-formatted – add your content—same thing for manuscript reviews. Just click “new,” then “review template,” and add the reviews. Remember to link the reviews back to the relevant manuscript. Rinse and repeat for status.\n\n\n\nWrapping up\nI’m still bad at project management. These changes have helped me focus on what needs to be done. Hopefully, it’s helpful for you too.\n\nCredits\nAll credit for the icons used here goes to smalllikeart on https://www.flaticon.com/, a free SVG icon site.

    "title": "The structure of US local governments is often a poor predictor of local economic growth",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Metropolitan economic growth is a perennial topic of interest to policymakers and scholars. Why do some areas flourish while others decline? Previous analyses suggest the underlying strength and structure of the economy is important, as is nicer weather. Another important consideration is the structure of local governments in a metropolitan area. The structure and powers of local government as a source of metropolitan growth are a popular topic in more international contexts. However, they have received significantly less attention in the US. States grant considerably more powers to local governments, and local governments are typically more numerous in the US than other parts of the world, making this an interesting case to study.\n\nThe influence of local governments on growth\nHow might the structure of local governments influence economic growth? There are two competing schools of thought. The “polycentrists” explain that more local governments can be a means to economic growth. Many local governments in an area create a competitive environment, where each government competes to provide public services most efficiently at the lowest cost. For overlapping local governments, the geographic differences in local government size offer the opportunity to match efficient production of services more closely, i.e., take advantage of economies of scale, and allow component local governments to make decisions on the level of service provision appropriate in their area.\nOn the opposing side, the “government reformists” suggest that fewer local governments can be a means to economic growth. Efficiency forms the core of the argument; however, mechanisms are different. Rather than focusing on competition-induced efficiency, the government reformists focus on potential administrative efficiencies of having fewer local governments. Eliminating duplication of services, overcoming coordination issues, and directly realizing economics of geographic scale are all possible mechanisms to drive growth.\nIn general, academic research falls more often on the polycentrists side. More local governments can be associated with higher growth or not, and city-county consolidations, a recommended government reform, is generally not related to economic growth.\n\n\nMeasuring economic growth in US metropolitan areas\nIn new research I analyze economic growth (population, jobs, per capita money income) from 1960 to 2000 in 314 metropolitan areas in the US. I borrow the methodology of Ed Glaeser of Harvard University and colleagues, where long-run economic growth is a function of the initial conditions of the metropolitan area (population, wealth, population growth, unemployment rate, manufacturing share, and percent of the population with a college degree). Those metropolitan areas with “better” initial conditions should grow more quickly in the following period.\nMy model includes information on five variables covering local government characteristics. The first three variables are: the share of the total metropolitan population residing in central cities, the average population of suburban (non-central) cities and the share of the metropolitan population that resides in unincorporated areas. These variables measure the influence of general-purpose local governments with higher values associated with lower political fragmentation. The last two measures, the number of school districts divided by the number of non-overlapping cities/townships, and the number of special districts divided by the number of non-overlapping cities/townships, relate to the influence of special-purpose local governments. Higher levels are associated with greater political fragmentation.\nFigure 1 shows the influence for my model’s variables with population growth as the dependent variable (results for jobs growth and income growth look similar). Of the general government structure variables, only the share of the central city population has any significant impact. Those metro areas with larger central cities relative to their suburbs declined in population on average, and the size of this effect grows as the period of growth increases. Special district overlap is a positive predictor of metropolitan growth in the longest time range as well.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 – Population growth, 1960-2000\n\n\n\nCompared to the other variables, local government structure is a poor predictor of metropolitan growth. Initial economic conditions such as prior growth or the unemployment rate are far better at predicting long-run growth.\nLooking more closely at regional differences\nBut what if the overall results are masking variations between regions? Metropolitan areas in different parts of the US grow differently, and local government structures may affect these metropolitan areas in different ways. Figure 2 examines this possibility by breaking down the sample by Census region.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 – Regional differences\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows that some local government structure factors affect economic growth differently depending on the region the metropolitan area is in. Local government structure has little effect on growth in metropolitan areas in the Midwest; however, the structure of the suburbs and special-purpose governments is important for the northeast. Results are far more mixed for the southern and western regions.\nThis research stands at odds with much of the international literature on decentralization and economic growth that suggests increased decentralization can be a means to enhanced growth. The US is a highly decentralized country from a governance perspective. The benefits of devolution are likely already baked into the system, whereas decentralization in highly centralized countries is new and more likely to shock the system.\n\n\nWhat does all this mean?\nPolicymakers in the US sometimes claim that the structure of local governments is helping or hindering economic growth in their areas. Some areas are highly fragmented, and it is easy to claim this is a significant impediment (or enhancement) to growth. My results suggest a more tepid response. The structure of local governments can be important, but it is often region-specific and easily overshadowed by the underlying economic characteristics of metropolitan areas.\nIf a policymaker wants to develop a strategy to enhance economic growth, there are better options than to propose a radical alteration to the existing local government structure. There is more bang for the buck in improving local educational opportunities or working to reduce unemployment.\nThis article is based on the paper, “Political Fragmentation & Economic Growth in US Metropolitan Areas” in the Journal of Urban Affairs."

    "text": "What I want from platform\nBefore I dive in, I have a few requirements from a platform.\n\nThe ability to organize content into discrete databases\nHierarchy of content\nSimple, intuitive formatting (i.e. markdown)\n\nThe first is really important to me. A database approach allows me to manipulate projects so I can see what I should be working on, what is dormant for right now, when I need to check on things, etc. As we’ll see, it’s a cornerstone of the approach I’ll describe below. Hierarchy is important because I need to nest items (reviews, research) inside of projects. Lastly, I don’t want to spend a ton of time messing around with formatting. I’ve found markdown to be a simple and intuitive way to make that happen.\n\n\nNotion and project management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotion is free for educators. Just put in your .edu email address and you’re good to go. The link above takes you to the educators site which has a lot of information about and templates for using Notion for teaching (scheduling, lesson planning, etc), but is fairly silent on project management.\n\nMaster project database\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis all starts with a master project database. You can create that by starting a new page and then choosing the “database” option for the type of page. Each line is a database entry for a single project identified by the paper title (you can change this at any time). I then tag each with the relevant article number (if under review), its status (in-process, under review, R&R’ed, or published), the journal, the last time there was a status change (I submitted it somewhere, it got rejected, etc), and any relevant due dates (you can also set reminders to any date in Notion). I’m only showing published and in-process work here for obvious reasons, but this highlights one of the benefits of arranging your project this way. I can filter projects by status and then save that filter as a “view” that I can come back to (see below). This allows me to quickly arrange my projects based on what I want to see rather than an overwhelming list of things to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I want to see only projects in the pre-submission phase, I can see only those in the “In Process” view. Or I can see only manuscripts under review so I can easily figure out if I need to check with the journal editor on its status. These views make it very easy for me to see the information that I want to see. There’s an immense level of customization for these views that you can tailor to your own needs.\n\n\nProject pages\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause each entry into the master project database is a page unto itself, you can use this organize information about the project. This is a project page for a manuscript that was published last year in Public Budgeting & Finance. It currently contains the abstract and the two rounds of reviews I had from PBAF (in further nested pages). However, this page can contain anything you like. If I had been using this system earlier, this would have reviews from the journals this paper was rejected from, notes about how I might alter the manuscript, or anything else I might want to save with this project. You could also do some task management here though I use another program (Things 3) to manage the day-to-day to-do lists associated with a project. How creative you want to get here or what system you want to use is completely up to you.\n\n\nTemplates\nA nice part of Notion is that you can create templates for new pages. In the master project database, the main template is for a new project. This pre-populates a new project page with areas for the abstract, reviews, and notes. You could pre-populate a new project with Mirya Holman’s Submission Checklist. The sky is the limit.\nIt’s a little thing that saves me time when I set up a new project to track.\n\n\n\nWrapping up\nI’m bad at project management though I’m much better than I used to be. This is a fairly simple way to keep track of a lot of projects and their associated content in Notion. I’m not suggesting this is the perfect system or even a preferable system for anyone other than me, but of the numerous things I’ve tried, this has stuck. It’s as close to how I map things out in my brain as I’ve found. Hopefully this as given you something to think about and an intro into a tool I have found incredibly valuable in my own work."

In nearly every large U.S. city, on-street, residential parking is essentially free. If these residents were to park in a private lot/garage/space (i.e. likely much closer to the market price for parking), it could be many hundreds of dollars per month in parking fees. This suggests the usage of this public asset is being severely underpriced. Meanwhile, public transit passes are significantly more expensive. In many cases, the monthly cost of a residential parking permit is less than a single fare on the central city transit system! While likely not covering the entire cost of public transit, the monthly transit pass is likely covering a much larger proportion of the per user cost of the transit system. It’s highly unlikely this is the case for street parking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPop.

Since residential street parking is often free (or minimally priced), the cost of upkeep and maintenance of street falls on all taxpayers through general taxation (usually the property tax). This is highly inequitable to non-street parking users who are asked to bear a portion of the cost while receiving no benefits.2 The public sector asks transit users to bear a much larger portion of the costs associated with their usage of the public transit infrastructure than car users are asked to bear.\nResidential street parking could be a decent revenue source for large cities. Vast sums of money are spent on the provision and maintenance of roads and few mechanisms exist to explicitly capture revenues associated with the usage of roads.3 Appropriately pricing residential street parking could do this in a direct way.\ntl;dr: Street parking in nearly all U.S. cities is vastly underpriced.\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nIt is important to note that in many of these cities the residential parking permit system (or zones) do not cover the entire city. In a great many locations in these cities, street parking is essentially free (or uncharged for by the public sector).↩︎\nThis doesn’t consider the social costs imposed either.↩︎\nThe disconnect between the provision of roads and the revenues to pay for them is and will get worse as the efficiency of the gas tax (the connection between the amount of the tax and the usage of roads) further declines. This is driven by both the failure of the gas tax to be increased (most specifically at the federal level, but also in a number of states) and, paradoxically, the increased popularity of electric or hybrid vehicles that can avoid some or all of the gas tax’s intended purpose as a fee on road usage.↩︎"

Garage Band (pre-packaged on all(?) iOS devices) is a completely free way to do this, but it has some quirks that I found distasteful. Mainly, I couldn’t find an easy way to see how long I had recorded in real time. Searching for alternatives, I stumbled on Charlie Sorrel’s three-part, “How to record podcasts on iPad” on Cult of Mac and pretty much followed the formula.\nThis required some specific paid software. I previous recorded/edited on a Mac using Audacity. It’s free, easy to use, and cross-platform if that’s important. Unfortunately, it’s not so cross-platform that I can use it on an iOS device. So I whipped out my credit card and headed to iTunes. A lot of these claim to be “free,” but I found the free versions are quite limited given what I wanted to do so I paid up. It appears many of these are small developers so I am more than happy to throw some cash their way for quality products.\n\n\n\n\niPad Audio Software\n\n\n\n\nAUM – Audio Mixer – for recording\nA noise reducing tool (I use Brusfri that is compatible on its own and in-line with AUM)\nAudioShare – audio file management plus some useful audio tools\nEditing software (Ferrite Recording Studio)\n\nAUM serves as my audio mixer and recording device (it can handle a number of audio inputs which is a nice perk should I ever decide to record with a partner) and I use Brusfri in-line as a noise reduction tool (my office is right below the main HVAC for the building and I didn’t want that hum in the recording). An added benefit of this set up is that I can use it as the voice over for screen captured video and voice over powerpoint. See Teddy Svoronos at HKS for more on that. At this point, I talk into the microphone.\nEditing is next. I use AudioShare mostly to level out any extreme peaks in the recording (it’s also integrated with AUM so it becomes very easy to categorize recordings) and then import it into Ferrite for editing. I mostly edit out the dead air and umms, but I sometimes get rid of whole passages that I don’t think hit right. I could insert new content here as well. I mostly follow Charlie’s method and the Apple Pencil is great here. Ferrite allows you to assign different actions to the pencil vs your finger. I have set up a left swipe of the pencil to select and delete. This makes it very simple to listen along and quickly edit out stuff.\nAll that’s left is to export to MP3 and upload to Blackboard. It seems like a lot, but I’ve found after the first one the process goes very quickly.\nAnd that’s it! Recording high quality audio lectures with a small and very portable setup."

Twitter is nice for quick thoughts, but this is important so I thought I’d expand upon that a bit. Off we go!\nIn theory, this is mostly a short-term issue, but there could be long-term implications depending on what happens in the real estate market. To plug my own research for a second, in the long-run, changes in assessed values are dependent on changes in house prices. Typically, it takes some time to translate changes in house prices to assessed value to property tax revenues. In general, this is a 3 to 4 year process. So if COVID-19 disrupts house prices in any way, the revenue impacts for local governments are pretty far off in the future on average.\nThe short-term is much more dependent on how property tax collections and distributions work and that’s state-specific."

    "section": "Illinois Property Taxes",
    "text": "Illinois Property Taxes\nFor the uninitiated, the property tax is an ad valorem tax. It applies a rate (millage rate) to a tax base (assessed value). In Illinois, the rates are set by the various taxing bodies and the tax base is usually determined by townships (in most things property tax in the state, Cook County (Chicago) is unique). Property is assessed at 33 1/3 percent of the fair market value of that property.\nIn Illinois, property tax collection is the realm of counties (county treasurers, specifically). The county sends out property tax bills, handles payments, and distributes tax revenues to the applicable taxing bodies. Generally, tax bills are sent out by May 1 with bills being due in two equal parts on June 1 and September 1. There are exceptions, of course. Counties can opt into a four-payment system and Cook County operates on an accelerated time table with 55% of the bill being due March 1 and 45% being due August 1. Failure to make a property tax payment on time incurs a 1.5% monthly interest penalty.\nOnce tax revenue is collected, it is distributed to taxing bodies beginning on June 1 (including any applicable interest) and then the first day of every month after. In general, counties stick to this schedule; however, there are certain programs that allow for deviations. For instance, counties alter this schedule for activated members of the Illinois National Guard or US military reserves who are deployed outside the United States. Important here is that when the President or Governor declare a disaster in all or part of a county, the rules for how late payments or due dates are treated change. In these situations, counties may adopt ordinances that delay due dates, suspend interest accumulation on late payments, and the like (see 35 ILCS 200/21-40(c)(1) for more information on the potential changes).\nAs of today, there are a number of collar counties that are trying to decide whether to implement programs that would suspend late penalties. DuPage County and Kendall County are debating. Kane County has already suspended late penalties (Update (2020-04-22): McHenry County has also suspended late penalties). Lake County debated implementing a delay, but ultimately chose not to do so."

    "section": "So What?",
    "text": "So What?\nThe primary issue in delaying payments (or not assessing penalties on late payments) is this has the potential to disrupt the transfer of tax revenues to taxing bodies and short-term cashflow. An open question is how prevalent delayed payments will be. Among the counties who have decided or are debating whether to adopt a delaying policy, the property tax base is overwhelming residential and heavily skewed toward owner-occupied single family homes. Many of these homes will have their property tax bills paid for through an escrow account managed by a mortgage servicer. At least for the June 1 payment, there’s likely sufficient reserves to pay property taxes; however, if homeowners begin to fail to make payments, there could be an issue.\nAt the end of the day, this is a big waiting game until the first revenue distribution on June 1. An additional issue is what is likely to play out is taxing body specific. If there are clusters of taxpayers who elect to delay payment, that may influence only a handful of taxing bodies. Or payment delays could be low but widespread, impacting individual local governments very little.\nWe just won’t know until June 1."

This part is totally up to you, but I’ve created a very common plot using the included mtcars data in R.\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(cowplot)\nlibrary(colorspace)\nlibrary(colorblindr)\n\nplot.data <- mtcars\n\np <- ggplot(plot.data, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl))) +\n  geom_point(size = 3) +\n  theme_minimal()\nThis uses the built in color scheme.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we wanted to desaturate this figure, what would it look like? How would we know if there is appropriate color separation so the reader could determine the various cyl levels? colorblindr gives us two ways to preview this; one static and one interactive.\ncvd_grid(p) # prints grid of colorblind types\nview_cvd(p) # starts an interactive app\nAs can be seen below, the standard color palette in ggplot is ok (but not great) on three of the colorblindness scales, but completely falls flat on desaturation. There’s no separation between the number of engine cylinders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow can we fix this? First, we need a new color scale. I am partial to viridis as it is designed to solve many of the problems outlined above (and built into R).\np.viridis <- p +\n  scale_colour_viridis_d()\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we subject this new figure to our colorblindness test, it performs much better.

That’s where colorspace comes in. It can do far more than we are going to use it for (see the CRAN vignette for more info), but it makes desaturating a breeze.\np.des.viridis <- edit_colors(p.viridis, desaturate)\nggdraw(p.des.viridis)\nUsing edit_colors(foo, desaturate), we can completely desaturate our figure. And ggdraw plots the figure for easy viewing. As can be seen below, our mission is accomplished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last step is to save the figure for upload. I tend to save these files as PDFs; however, the journal likely has its own preferred file format (TIFF being really common).\nggsave(plot=p.des.viridis, \"p_des_viridis.pdf\", dpi=300, device = cairo_pdf)\nAnd that’s it! Easy, reproducible desaturation (with a brief sidebar into colorblind friendly color palettes)."

Yet, it persists.\nBelow, I replicate Figure 1 from Gabaix (1999) by plotting the logarithm of size rank against the logarithm of size (i.e population) for the largest 135 metropolitan statistical areas in the U.S using 2010 census data (rather than 1991 data). We can see the typical downward sloping relationship found by Gabaix and others. Gabaix suggests the slope of the regression line should be roughly one and this is replicated, albeit slightly more negative than what was found using the 1991 data.\n\n\n\n\n\\[ln\\, Rank = 18.891 - 1.082\\; ln\\, Size, \\;R^2=0.978\\]\n\n\n\nIf Zipf’s law is to be believed, the above graph suggests that the largest cities (those with low log rank on the right side) are too small to fit Zipf’s law perfectly. They fall below the trend line and should be, in a perfect Zipf’s law world, larger than they actually are. This likely comports with the general understanding that large, coastal U.S. cities aren’t growing nearly fast enough to accommodate all the individuals who might want to locate there.\nAs Ed Glaeser notes, it appears that Zipf’s law for cities is a function of the outward growth of cities. When examining fixed boundary geographies, Zipf’s law appears not to apply. Therefore, the sprawling nature of many U.S. cities appears to be a fundamental part of Zipf’s law holding.\nWhen expanded to the full data on all 382 metropolitan areas, things change slightly but the more or less linear relationship between rank and size is preserved. In this instance, both the largest and the smallest metropolitan areas appear to be too small to fit Zipf’s law. This is a trend noted by Ed Glaeser as well.\n\n\n\n\n\\[ln\\, Rank = 16.283 - 0.896\\; ln\\, Size, \\;R^2=0.976\\]"

    "title": "Maps in R using {urbnmapr}",
    "section": "Example",
    "text": "Example\nLet’s dive into any example. Since my last Maps in R post used data on the Metropolitan Power Diffusion Index for special districts from year 2012, we’ll use the same data. The base data comes from the 2012 Census of Governments\nurbnmapr is a package to map states and/or counties in ggplot2 so for simplicity sake, we’ll load the entire tidyverse library. We’ll need to load dplyr for the join anyways. I have loaded the viridis library to gain access to the Viridis color scale. This isn’t necessary, but I like the color options.\nTo add the MPDI data to the urbnmapr data, left_join() from the dplyr package is used. One thing to pay close attention to is this requires the joining data to be of the same class. county_fips in urbnmapr::counties is of class character; hence, my import of the county FIPS variable as “character”.\n\nlibrary(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(\"viridis\")\nlibrary(\"urbnmapr\")\n\n# Add data\nmpdi <- read.csv(\"mpdi.csv\", header=TRUE, sep=\",\",\n        quote=\"\\\"\", colClass=c(\"character\", \"numeric\"))\n# Join with urbnmapr\nmpdi.data <- left_join(mpdi, counties, by = \"county_fips\")\nWith the data imported and joined, I next define some cut points in the data. This step isn’t strictly necessary depending on your data (ggplot2 will attempt to map any numerical data on a continuous scale). For these data, defining some cut points makes for a more meaningful map.\n\n# Create quantiles\nno_classes <- 6\nlabels <- c()\nquantiles <- quantile(mpdi.data$mpdi,\n                      probs = seq(0, 1, length.out = no_classes + 1))\n# Custom labels, rounding\nlabels <- c()\nfor(idx in 1:length(quantiles)){\n  labels <- c(labels, paste0(round(quantiles[idx], 2),\n  \" – \",\n  round(quantiles[idx + 1], 2)))\n}\n# Minus one label to remove the odd ending one\nlabels <- labels[1:length(labels)-1]\n\n# Create new variable for fill\nmpdi.data$mpdi.quantiles <- cut(mpdi.data$mpdi,\n  breaks = quantiles,\n  labels = labels,\n  include.lowest = T)\nFrom here, we plot! If you’re at all familiar with ggplot2, this should look very familiar. The two geom_polygon lines define the filled county map and the state outline map. coord_map() defines the map projection. Urban’s post uses the Albers projection, but I happen to like the polyconic projection and that’s what is used here. coord_map() can use any projection in the mapproj package so the choice of projection is up to you. scale_fill_viridis() uses the virdis library to assign colors. I have reversed the usual color scale and trimmed off the top color (end=0.9, bright yellow). The remainder of the code is theming. I remove all the axis labels and coloring, change the default font, and move the legend around.\n\nggplot() +\n  # County map\n  geom_polygon(data = mpdi.data,\n    mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,\n      group = group,\n      fill = mpdi.data$mpdi.quantiles)) +\n  # Add state outlines\n  geom_polygon(data = urbnmapr::states,\n    mapping = aes(long, lat,group = group),\n    fill = NA, color = \"#ffffff\", size = 0.4) +\n  # Projection\n  coord_map(projection = \"polyconic\")+\n  # Fill color\n  scale_fill_viridis(\n    option = \"viridis\",\n    name = \"Metropolitan Power Diffusion Index\",\n    discrete = T,\n    direction = -1,\n    end=0.9,\n    guide = guide_legend(\n      keyheight = unit(5, units = \"mm\"),\n      title.position = 'top',\n      reverse = F)\n    )+\n  # Theming\n  theme_minimal(base_family = \"Open Sans Condensed Light\")+\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"bottom\",\n    legend.text.align = 0,\n    plot.margin = unit(c(.5,.5,.2,.5), \"cm\")) +\n  theme(\n    axis.line = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.y = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    )+\n  theme(plot.title=element_text(family=\"Open Sans Condensed Bold\", margin=margin(b=15)))+\n  theme(plot.subtitle=element_text(family=\"Open Sans Condensed Light Italic\"))+\n  theme(plot.margin=unit(rep(0.5, 4), \"cm\"))+\n  labs(x = \"\",\n       y = \"\",\n       title = \"Example map using the Data@Urban `urbnmapr'\",\n       subtitle = \"Metropolitan Power Diffusion Index, Special Districts 2012\",\n       caption = \"Author: Chris Goodman (@cbgoodman), Data: U.S. Census Bureau Census of Governments\")"

As I move all my graphics production to ggplot2, urbnmapr is my new go-to for simple state or county mapping.

As a result, managers are expected to be fluent in quantitative analytical skills. This course is a graduate level, introductory statistics and research methodology course. It will focus on applied quantitative analysis for public/nonprofit management and policy. The goal of the course is two-fold: (1) to train you to apply the concepts presented and use them to inform real world decision-making in the public and nonprofit sectors and (2) to prepare you to successfully complete your capstone project.\n            \n                 Spring 2019\n                 Fall 2018\n                 Spring 2018\n                 Fall 2017\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                Public & Nonprofit Budgeting \n            \n            \n                PA 8400 | \n                University of Nebraska at Omaha\n            \n            This course introduces students to the theory and practice of budgeting at all levels of government and in the nonprofit sector. Particular emphasis is given to budgeting in local government because of its historical role as an incubator for budget innovations and its accessibility to citizens. Additionally, nonprofit budgeting is emphasized because of the increasing role of nonprofits in public service delivery. This course equips students with competence in the use of budgeting terminology, innovations in budget preparation, the linkage of the budget to the accounting and financial reporting systems, and the role of technology in shaping budget preparation and administrative implementation.\n            \n                 Spring 2017\n            \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            \n                Quantitative Methods in Public Administration \n            \n            \n                PA 9950 | \n                University of Nebraska at Omaha\n            \n            This course is an introduction to the theory and application of linear modeling to economic and public policy problems.

As with most research in this realm, these decisions are inextricably linked to issues of public spending, taxation, and state policy. I tend to focus on specific questions dealing with the special district form of local government as these governments are under-researched in the relevant literature.
